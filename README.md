This project is an Online Payment Fraud Detection system developed using Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Plotly. It leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to predict fraud based on transaction attributes such as transaction type, amount, and balances. The app provides interactive visualizations and key metrics like precision, accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix for model evaluation, enhancing fraud detection capabilities in online payment systems.
